#This project focuses on developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system capable of converting printed, 
handwritten, or scanned text into machine-readable digital formats. 
The system utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques 
to accurately identify and extract textual information from images or documents.
